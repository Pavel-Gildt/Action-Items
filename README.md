# Action Items - OneVizion

The Action Item module is designed to operate like an action item register and help reduce other methods for tracking open actions and help teams collaborate and troubleshoot issues.  

Common uses:
Engineering.  Troubleshooting commissioning issues. Retain history of configurations, track age of action item and time since last comment. The responsible department, assigned user, and notes field can be updated until the issue is resolved.

Asset Management. Tracking future contract obligations.  Use action items to document lease obligations and schedule a reminder for renewals, payments, and certifications. 

Deployment. Tracking construction gating items.  Use the Vizion Package like a traditional action item register to track outstanding documents and other requirements for construction. Assign responsible departments and keep notes on progress and issues until resolved.

Note. The Action Items are a child to the Project Tracker and the Lease Tracker. Additional relationships can be added to track actions for other business processes.
You may also attach Action Items to other trackors, please consult your provider to learn more.
